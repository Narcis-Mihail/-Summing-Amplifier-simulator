# -Summing-Amplifier-simulator
The interface implemented in Matlab simulates a summing circuit with operational amplifier;
Through the interface we can change the values of signals, resistances, as well as supply voltages of the operational amplifier that limit the voltage, which cannot be higher than the supply voltage;
